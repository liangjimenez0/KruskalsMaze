How to play the Maze Game:

- Key 'b' to run a breadth first search

- Key 'd' to run a depth first search

- Key 'r' to design a new random maze

- Key 'R' to start a new maze without restarting the program (aka start again with the same maze)

- Key 'u' to take away the viewing of the visited paths

- Key 'v' to see the viewing of the visited paths

On the bottom of the screen are the scores of the wrong moves for BFS and DFS. These moves reset each time you
reset the board.

Once the search is completed, the path will automatically be shown for the user.
